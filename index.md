The SWC mod comes from an effort to rebalance Squad's meta for competitive play, with additional features to help casters make their streams more dynamic and informative.

# Balance
Rather than configuring gameplay mechanics within the Squad modding tools to one-size-fits-all values, we have exposed values for customization by event coordinators. These values can be modified via config files stored within the mod folder or ingame via a custom UI. Configuration is only read from the server's mod folder, so players don't need to download configuration files. As with the rest of the mod's features, access to the ingame UI for editing config is limited to players with the Admin Cam role.

# Casters
All of the following features are available only to users in Admin Cam.

### Flag status 
A persistent display at the top of the screen showing the AAS lattice and the team owning each flag.

### Kill & Event feed
A persistent feed in a panel at the top right which shows infantry kills as they happen, as well as FOB, HAB, or vehicle destruction.

### Event point of interest icons
When a FOB, HAB, vehicle, or flag capture event occurs, an icon is placed above the event in the game world showing what type of event occurred. The `Q` key will automatically move the camera to the event's location so that casters can quickly react to events as they happen. The `E` key returns the camera to the original location.

### Follow camera



### Spectate camera
